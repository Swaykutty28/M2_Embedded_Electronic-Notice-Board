**REQUIREMENTS:**

**INTRODUCTION:**

- In this era the leading edge of world in connectivity people demand simple and time saves method access information.
- Notice board is very primitive method used in institutions or public business places like bus travel stations, colleges, malls etc.
- The primary goal of this work is to create a smart notice board which can operates in a well-organized manner with respect to date and time.
- It helps the user to constantly keep track of the notice board every time he uses the system and to convey the information more productivity.

**OBJECTIVES:**

- To display various notices without the message being typed manually.
- It proposes an inventive approach of voice recognition notice board display.
- To dictate the message via an android phone which then the voice message is converted into a text message via an application i.e. “voice command”.
- To avoid the workload of giving inputs at each and every time.

**FEATURES:**

- Highly flexible and reliable.
- Used in real world practical application.
- Entire sentence can be recognized and manipulated.

**TECHNICAL FEATURES:**

- Operating Voltage.
- Operating Current.
- The HC-05 Bluetooth Module.

`  `**WHAT:**
**
`       `The main concept behind Voice operated Electronic notice board using a rolling display is to show scrolling messages and to control them by using our own voice.

`   `**WHO:**

`        `The user has to give voice commands to the android app. The android app then passes these commands to the microcontroller using wireless communication.

`     `**WHEN:**
**
`          `A specific person is required to take care of the notice displays in the conventional method. Bundles of paper are being used and this is followed by wastage of paper by the management. To meet the demands of the huge amount of paper causes immense deforestation hence, providing a pathway to global warming.

`      `**WHERE:**
**
`           `Nowadays, every schools, colleges, private libraries, shopping malls, and other organization depends on this electronic based notice board system. It is very essential to them.

`       `**HOW:**
**
`            `This project is implemented to do the information displaying by sending an voice message to the microcontroller.

`  `**SWOT ANALYSIS:**

`     `**STRENGTH:**

- No need of any difficulty wires to display the information.
- Easy to operate.
- Consumes less power.
- This circuit is handy.

`       `**WEAKNESS:**

- When there is a network problem, the phone doesn’t work.
- If the mobile runs out of charge, we could not able to send the voice message to the microcontroller.

`       `**THREATS:**

`        `On their downside, online system boards come with their fair share of threats. Since they are public places, they are often unedited and open to troublemakers who like controversies. They hide behind their screens to badmouth the users and the content posted.

`       `**OPPURTUNITIES:**
**
`       `By introducing the concept of wireless technology in the Field of the communication we can make our communication more efficient and faster, with greater efficiency. We can display the messages with less errors and maintenance.
